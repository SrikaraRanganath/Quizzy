                <em>Quizzy</em> is a full stack web application that allows users to create and hold an online quiz experience seamlessly. It was designed with <u>scalability</u> in mind. By using the <strong>MERN</strong> stack and making use of redux, redux-thunk, axios, react-router, mongoose.
                The use of MongoDB for the database makes it extremely fast and scalable as it reduced the number of joins required to execute a query.
                In addition to scalability, it makes development extremely easy as the complex structure of the data and its relationship is reduced 
                to nested json like objects.
